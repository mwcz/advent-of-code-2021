# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

My Advent of Code 2021 solutions, in Rust.

I didn't know about [cargo-aoc](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-aoc) when I started this, so these follow my own layout.

All examples require `cargo` to build.  See [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

To run a given day's solution:

```
cd day3 # or any other day

# run part 1
cargo run --bin part1 < input

# run part 2
cargo run --bin part2 < input
```
